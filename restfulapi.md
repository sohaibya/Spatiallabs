A RESTful API uses commands to obtain resources. The state of a resource at any given timestamp is called a resource representation. A RESTful API uses existing HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC 2616 protocol, such as:

GET to retrieve a resource;
PUT to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file or block;
POST to create that resource; and
DELETE to remove it.
